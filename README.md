# 1. Introduction

The OpenCDE Foundation API includes a small number of services and a few conventions that are common to all OpenCDE APIs.

OpenCDE APIs support the exchange of information between software applications via a [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) web interface, which means that data is exchanged via HTTP query parameters and JSON payloads. 
URL schemas in this README are relative to the OpenCDE API servers' base-URL unless an absolute value is provided.

## 1.1 Paging, Sorting and Filtering

When requesting collections of items, the Server should offer URL parameters according to the [OData v4 specification](http://www.odata.org/documentation/).

## 1.2 Caching

ETags, or entity-tags, are an important part of HTTP, being a critical part of caching, and also used in "conditional" requests.

The ETag response-header field value, an entity tag, provides for an "opaque" cache validator.
The easiest way to think of an etag is as an MD5 or SHA1 hash of all the bytes in a representation. If just one byte in the representation changes, the etag will change.

ETags are returned in a response to a GET:

    joe@joe-laptop:~$ curl --include http://bitworking.org/news/
    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    Date: Wed, 21 Mar 2007 15:06:15 GMT
    Server: Apache
    ETag: "078de59b16c27119c670e63fa53e5b51"
    Content-Length: 23081
    â€¦

The client may send an "If-None-Match" HTTP Header containing the last retrieved etag. If the content has not changed the server returns a status code 304 (not modified) and no response body.

## 1.3 Updating Resources via HTTP PUT

Whenever a resource offers the HTTP PUT method, it is to be updated as a whole.

This means that there is no partial update mechanism for objects but every PUT request is sending the whole object representation.

## 1.4 Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

To work with browser based API clients using [Cross Origin Resource Sharing (Cors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), servers will put the `Access-Control-Allow'` headers in the response headers and specify who can access the servers JSON resources. The client can look for these values and proceed with accessing the resources.

In a CORS scenario, web clients expect the following headers:
* `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, Accept` to allow the `Authorization`, `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to be used via [XHR requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest)
* `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, OPTIONS` to allow the Http methods the API needs
* `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: example.com` to allow XHR requests from the `example.com` domain to the API server

For example, Asp.Net applications in IIS need the following entries in their `web.config` file. `*` means the server allows any values.

    <httpProtocol>
        <customHeaders>
            <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Headers" value="Content-Type, Accept, X-Requested-With,  Authorization" />
            <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Methods" value="GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS" />
            <add name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" value="*" />
        </customHeaders>
    </httpProtocol>

## 1.5 Http Status Codes

Web-based APIs rely on the regular Http Status Code definitions. Good sources are [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) or the [HTTP/1.1 Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231).

Generally, these response codes shall be used in the API:
* `200 - OK` for `GET` requests that return data or `PUT` requests that update data
* `201 - Created` for `POST` requests that create data
* `401 - Unauthorized` for requests that have errors when the user is not authenticated
* `403 - Forbidden` for requests when the user is authenticated but not authorized to perform the operation

`POST` and `PUT` requests do usually include the created/modified resource in the response body. Exceptions to this rule are described in the specific section for the resource.

### 1.5.1 Conflict on creation

For resource creation by `POST` with optional GUID specified, if the GUID already exists in the target system, status code `409 - Conflict` will be returned.

## 1.6 Error Response Body Format

All OpenCDE APIs have a specified error response body format [error.json](schemas/error.json).

## 1.7 DateTime Format

DateTime values in this API are supposed to be in ISO 8601 compliant `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` format with optional time zone indicators. This is the same format as defined in the Xml `xs:dateTime` type as well as the result of JavaScripts Date.toJson() output.

For example, `2016-04-28T16:31:12.270+02:00` would represent _Thursday, April 28th, 2016, 16:31:12 (270ms) with a time zone offset of +2 hours relative to UTC._
Please note that the colon in the timezone offset is optional, so `+02:00` is equivalent to `+0200`.

To void ambiguity, This specification steps away from ISO 8601 on the topic of DateTime values with no timezone: The ISO 8601 says that DateTime values with no timezone designator are local times - **In BCF all DateTime values with no timezone designator are assumed to be in UTC. Therefore, adding a timezone designator is highly recommended**.

## 1.8 Additional Response and Request Object Properties

All API response and request JSON objects may contain additional properties that are not part of the specified exchange for that endpoint.
This is to allow server and client implementations freedom to add additional functionality. Servers and clients shall ignore those properties and must not produce errors on additional properties. Servers and clients are not required to preserve these properties.

## 1.9 Binary File Uploads

Some endpoints may expect binary file uploads, such as the BCF Document Service and the BCF BIM Snippet Service.

In such cases, files should be sent with the following Http headers:

    Headers:
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream;
    Content-Length: {Size of file in bytes};
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="{Filename.extension}";

## 1.10 Differences Between null and Empty Lists

Some array or list properties and responses can be interpreted differently if they are either `null` or empty. In general, there are two cases to consider.

**For collection resources:**

* A collection resource that does not exist should return Http error `404 - Not Found`, e.g. the list of topics for an invalid project id.
* If the resource exists but there are no elements, the returned response should be an empty array `[]`, e.g. the list of topics for a project where no topics exist.

**For properties:**

* If a list property is `null` (by explicitly setting it to null or not returning it in the response object at all), the client should not assume that this represents an empty list but instead the property is not present on the response object. Depending on the response object, this can have the same meaning as an empty list (e.g. no components in a viewpoint is the same as an empty list of components), but this can also mean the property is just omitted for optional properties (e.g. no `topic_actions` in an `authorization` object can mean no restrictions).

## 1.11 HTTPS/TLS

To ensure the security of API exchanges servers should only expose API endpoints over HTTPS with a minimal TLS version of 1.2.

    Body:
    {
        "versions": [{
            "api_id": "opencde-foundation",
            "version_id": "1.0",
            "detailed_version": "https://github.com/BuildingSMART/opencde-foundation-API/tree/release_1_0"
        }, {
            "api_id": "bcf",
            "version_id": "2.1",
            "detailed_version": "https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-API/tree/release_2_1"
            "api_base_url": "https://server.base.url/bcf/2.1"
        }, {
            "api_id": "bcf",
            "version_id": "3.0",
            "detailed_version": "https://github.com/buildingSMART/BCF-API/tree/release_3_0"
            "api_base_url": "https://server.base.url/somepath/bcf/3.0"
        }]
    }

## 2.2 Authentication Services

### 2.2.1 Obtaining Authentication Information

[auth_GET.json](schemas/auth_GET.json)

Authentication is based on the [OAuth 2.0 Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-22).

**Resource URL (public resource)**

    GET /opencde/{version}/auth

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Type|Description|Required|
|---------|----|-----------|--------|
|oauth2_auth_url|string|URL to authorization page (used for Authorization Code Grant and Implicit Grant OAuth2 flows)|false|
|oauth2_token_url|string|URL for token requests|false|
|oauth2_dynamic_client_reg_url|string|URL for automated client registration|false|
|http_basic_supported|boolean|Indicates if Http Basic Authentication is supported|false|
|supported_oauth2_flows|string[]|array of supported OAuth2 flows|true|

If `oauth2_auth_url` is present, then `oauth2_token_url` must also be present and vice versa. If properties are not present in the response, clients should assume that the functionality is not supported by the server, e.g. a missing `http_basic_supported` property would indicate that Http basic authentication is not available on the server.

OAuth2 flows are described in detail in the [OAuth2 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). OpenCDE API servers may support the following flows:
* `authorization_code_grant` - [4.1 - Authorization Code Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)
* `implicit_grant` - [4.2 - Implicit Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2)
* `resource_owner_password_credentials_grant` - [4.3 - Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3)

The [OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant (section 4.4)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) is not supported since it does not contain any user identity.
Also the [Extension Grants (section 4.5)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.5) are not supported.

**Example Request**

    GET /opencde/1.0/auth

**Example Response**

    Response Code: 200 - OK
    Body:
    {
        "oauth2_auth_url": "https://example.com/opencde/oauth2/auth",
        "oauth2_token_url": "https://example.com/opencde/oauth2/token",
        "oauth2_dynamic_client_reg_url": "https://example.com/opencde/oauth2/reg",
        "http_basic_supported": true,
        "supported_oauth2_flows": [
            "authorization_code_grant",
            "implicit_grant",
            "resource_owner_password_credentials_grant"
        ]
    }

### 2.2.2 OAuth2 Example

An example for the OAuth2 Authorization Grant workflow [can be found here](OAuth2Examples.md).

### 2.2.3 OAuth2 Protocol Flow - Dynamic Client Registration

[dynRegClient\_POST.json](schemas/dynRegClient_POST.json)

[dynRegClient\_GET.json](schemas/dynRegClient_GET.json)

The following part describes the optional dynamic registration process of a client. OpenCDE API Servers may offer additional processes registering clients, for example allowing a client application developer to register his client on the servers website.

The resource url for this service is server specific and is returned as `oauth2_dynamic_client_reg_url` in the `GET /opencde/{version}/auth` resource.

Register a new client :

**Parameters**

|client_name|string|The client name|
|client_description|string|The client description|
|client_url|string|An URL providing additional information about the client|
|redirect_url|string|An URL where users are redirected after granting access to the client|

**Example Request**

    Body:
    {
        "client_name": "Example Application",
        "client_description": "Example CAD desktop application",
        "client_url": "http://example.com",
